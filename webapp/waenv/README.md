# notes on envs

Rather than have the env dirs scattered about.  Here is a place for the webapps to keep python venv setups.
NOTE: these are separate from the envs used by the notebooks.

## creating

```
$ cd waenv
$ python3 -m venv waenv
$ source waenv/bin/activate
```

## using requirements.txt

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
